# SplineLib
Library for spline manipulation.

## Features
Functionalities:

  - BSplines/NURBSs of arbitrary dimensionalities;
  - knot insertion/removal and degree elevation/reduction;
  - IGES, IRIT, and XML input/output (converter) as well as VTK output (sampler).

Software Development:

  - [Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) support for handling dependencies and deployment of SplineLib.
  - C++20 complying with [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) (a C++17 version
    is available using `git checkout c++17`).
  - CMake tools tested with apple-clang, clang, and gcc compilers (if your CMake version is less than 3.19, consider
    `git checkout cmake`).
  - Extensive unit tests using GTest and GMock.

## Getting Started
SplineLib can be compiled using, e.g., *apple-clang12*, *clang11* or *GCC10*.  Start off by cloning the SplineLib
repository and changing to SplineLib's root directory

	 $ git clone https://github.com/SplineLib/SplineLib.git && cd SplineLib

SplineLib depends on *pugixml* and *GoogleTest* (if you do not disable testing).  The following deployment instructions
for SplineLib differ depending on whether you want to use 1.) *spack* or 2.) *CMake*.  Please skip the additional
instructions provided for using SplineLib on CLAIX if you use a system different from CLAIX.

<details><summary><strong>Preparations on CLAIX</strong></summary><p>
The following commands prepare your environment on CLAIX for deploying SplineLib

	$ module purge && module load DEVELOP clang/11 gcc/10 cmake
</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Building/Installing using <em>Spack</em></strong></summary><p>
<em>Spack</em> (see <a href=https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation><em>spack</em>'s
installation instructions</a>) is convenient to manage SplineLib's dependencies

	$ spack install googletest+gmock~pthreads pugixml

In addition, <em>spack</em> can also be used for SplineLib itself.  Begin by registering SplineLib's *spack* package

	 $ spack repo add Scripts/Spack/splinelib

and continue by either installing SplineLib from GitHub and making it available in your current environment

	$ spack install splinelib && spack load splinelib

or by developing your modifiable copy of the SplineLib repository

	$ spack dev-build -b install --test root splinelib@github build_type=Debug

At some point in time, you can remove the `-b install` option from the previous command if you want *spack* to not stop
before the install phase.
</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Building/Installing using <em>CMake</em></strong></summary><p>
If you do not want to use <em>spack</em>, you can also take care of SplineLib's dependencies and build system on your
own.  Start with creating a build directory

	 $ mkdir Build && cd Build

and then (after making sure that SplineLib's dependencies are available) build and test your version of SplineLib using
<em>CMake</em>'s Unix Makefiles generator

	$ ctest --build-and-test .. . --build-generator "Unix Makefiles" --build-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
	  --test-command ctest

being a handy shortcut for invoking the equivalent command sequence

	$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug && make clean && make -j && ctest

or create an Xcode project by using *CMake*'s Xcode generator

	$ cmake .. -G Xcode

If you eventually want to install SplineLib, you can type

	$ make install

or

	$ xcodebuild install
